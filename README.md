# All Programs [ APS ]

*-> Trying to keep all the programs as updated as possible. If you are sure about how GitHub works, feel free to open pull requests to correct any mistakes*

*-> I will be adding in new programs as soon as it is given in college, if you want to contribute like I mentioned feel free to open pull requests*

*-> Git is really helpful in maintaining things similar to this, I personally recommend ya'll to sit there and learn a little basics of GitHub - promise it will help you on the long run*

**------- COPYING IT ON THE LAB RECORD ----------**

*--> While writing file names of txt files, binary files and CSV files - try and change the name of the file. Usually the name of the file is defined in lines that look like `f = open("smack.txt", "r+")` | Just try and change smack.txt to a text file of a name you like so it looks like you've done something minimal*

*--> Don't forget sample outputs. Sample outputs are needed for the lab record to be complete. Left side of each program - the sample output exactly how it looks like on the console shall be copied.*

*--> I've personally scripted these programs alone and checked its working at 12 in the morning, there can be possible human syntax errors, spelling mistakes etc. If you have issues with your code or want to correct my code, do not hesitate to DM me through discord or open a pull request on GitHub with your correction*

**--> Hoping this was of some help to all ya'll. Have fun copying it into the record.**
